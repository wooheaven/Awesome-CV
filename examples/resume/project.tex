    {Software Engineer, Data Scientist} % Role
    {Develop eDataLyzer} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Nov. 2013 - Present, more than 30 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The eDataLyzer is a existing semiconductor analytics product for wafer yield map classification and root cause correlation.}
        \item {The goal of this project is to redevelop the eDataLyzer for big data.}
        \item {So we have led this project in three ways.}
        \item {1st, reconstruct the architecture to micro services from monolithic one.}
        \item {2nd, reorganize to a role based teams from a unified team.(Client, Server, Algorithm, Research, Technical Sales/Support.)}
        \item {3rd, redevelop by Java and C\# not only C\#}
        \item {I belong to Algorithm team, mainly focusing on parallelizing algorithm by new big data technologies.}
        \item {In briefly, I have done three ways of parallelizing algorithms.}
        \item {1st, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Java, PostgreSQL, Spring for small data clients.}
        \item {2nd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by non Hadoop based technologies.(GreenPlumDataBase PL/Java, Oracle-R)}
        \item {3rd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Hadoop based technologies.(Hadoop, BDA, Hawq, HBase, Spark, Eco system)}
        \item {In this project, we have a lot of semiconductor clients.(Korea: Samsung Electronics, SKHynix, SKSiltron, Japan: Toshiba, Sharp, Taiwan: TSMC, China: BOE)}

    {Researcher, Software Engineer} % Role
    {Research to Apply Reinforcement Learning on Semiconductor} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Dec. 2018 - Present, 9 months, 6 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to apply reinforcement learning on semiconductor and share the experience with team.}
        \item {I pick up 8-Puzzle as a environment for reinforcement learning.}
        \item {Here's why I pick up it in details.}
        \item {1st, in order to collaborate with teammates, I need to find the generalized environment is easy to apply Graph Theory.}
        \item {So I pick up operation management of production on semiconductor.}
        \item {2nd, in order to find suitable environment not complex one, I pick up 9-Puzzle.}
        \item {Focus on shortest path not yield, productivity, stability, automation rate, etc.}
        \item {The recent research situation is as follows.}
        \item {1st, solve 8-Puzzle by Dynamic Programming}
        \item {2nd, fail to solve 8-Puzzle by QLearning, Deep SARSA, Polish Gradient.}
        \item {The rest of the research is to find out why and how to overcome it.}

    {Software Engineer} % Role
    {Develop Matrix Profile on Transfer System} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Jul. 2017 - Dec. 2017, 5 months, 2 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to predict a shutdown of motor based on time series sensed data.}
        \item {Client's product-lines(blue-collars) found out a shutdown once a year and hate this problem.}
        \item {But both client's office-lines(white-collars) and our previous algorithm didn't predict it.}
        \item {Because the algorithm focus on a vibration analysis on rotationary machine.}
        \item {So we created this project as a subproject of the previous one and led this project as below.}
        \item {1st, we found out the matrix profile which is a suitable algorithm for time series predict.}        
        \item {2nd, I implemented the algorithm in python and deploy it to client. And solve the problem successfully.}
        \item {3rd, I implemented it in java and integrate with UI. Teached clients how to solve their problem through our product.}
        \item {This project's client is Hyundai Motor.}
