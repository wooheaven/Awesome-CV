        \item {2nd, reorganize to a role based teams from a unified team.(Client, Server, Algorithm, Research, Technical Sales/Support.)}
        \item {3rd, redevelop by Java and C\# not only C\#}
        \item {I belong to Algorithm team, mainly focusing on parallelizing algorithm by new big data technologies.}
        \item {In briefly, I have done three ways of parallelizing algorithms.}
        \item {1st, redevelop the algorithms by Java, PostgreSQL, Spring for small data.}

    {Research to Apply Reinforcement Learning on Semiconductor} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Dec. 2018 - Present, 9 months, 6 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to apply reinforcement learning on semiconductor and share the experience with team.}
        \item {Chose 8-puzzles as a reinforcement learning environment for the following reasons.}
        \item {1st, in order to collaborate with teammates, I need the generalized environment is easy to apply Graph Theory.}
        \item {So I picked up operation management of production on semiconductor.}
        \item {2nd, in order to find suitable environment not complex one, I pick up 8-Puzzle as a simplified the opearation management of production on semiconductor.}
        \item {Focus on shortest path not yield, productivity, stability, automation rate, realtime, etc.}
        \item {The recent research situation is as follows.}
        \item {1st, solve 8-Puzzle by Dynamic Programming and compare by the other algorithms such as Shortest-path tree, Dijkstra.}
        \item {2nd, fail to solve 8-Puzzle by QLearning, Deep SARSA, Polish Gradient.}
        \item {The rest of the research is to find out why and how to overcome it.}

    {Software Engineer} % Role
    {Develop Matrix Profile on Transfer System} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Jul. 2017 - Dec. 2017, 6 months, 2 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to predict a shutdown of motor based on time series sensed data.}
        \item {Client's product-lines(blue-collars) found out a shutdown once a year and hate this problem.}
        \item {But both client's office-lines(white-collars) and our previous algorithm didn't predict it.}
        \item {Because the algorithm focus on a vibration analysis on rotationary machine.}
        \item {So we created this project as a subproject of the previous one and led this project as below.}
        \item {1st, we found out the matrix profile which is a suitable algorithm for time series predict.}
        \item {2nd, I implemented the algorithm in python and deploy it to client. And solve the problem successfully.}
        \item {3rd, I implemented it in java and integrate with UI. Teached clients how to solve their problem through our product.}
        \item {The client of this project is Hyundai Motor. And the project type is PoC.}
