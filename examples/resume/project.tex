    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to apply reinforcement learning on semiconductor and share the experience with team.}
        \item {I pick up 8-Puzzle as a environment for reinforcement learning.}
        \item {Here's why I pick up it in details.}
        \item {1st, in order to collaborate with teammates, I need to find the generalized environment is easy to apply Graph Theory.}
        \item {So I pick up operation management of production on semiconductor.}
        \item {2nd, in order to find suitable environment not complex one, I pick up 8-Puzzle.}
        \item {Focus on shortest path not yield, productivity, stability, automation rate, etc.}
        \item {The recent research situation is as follows.}
        \item {1st, solve 8-Puzzle by Dynamic Programming}
        \item {2nd, fail to solve 8-Puzzle by QLearning, Deep SARSA, Polish Gradient.}
        \item {The rest of the research is to find out why and how to overcome it.}

    {Software Engineer} % Role
    {Develop Matrix Profile on Transfer System} % Event
    {Seoul, S.Korea} % Location
    {Jul. 2017 - Dec. 2017, 6 months, 2 M/M} % Date(s)
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The goal of this project is to predict a shutdown of motor based on time series sensed data.}
        \item {Client's product-lines(blue-collars) found out a shutdown once a year and hate this problem.}
        \item {But both client's office-lines(white-collars) and our previous algorithm didn't predict it.}
        \item {Because the algorithm focus on a vibration analysis on rotationary machine.}
        \item {So we created this project as a subproject of the previous one and led this project as below.}
        \item {1st, we found out the matrix profile which is a suitable algorithm for time series predict.}
        \item {2nd, I implemented the algorithm in python and deploy it to client. And solve the problem successfully.}
        \item {3rd, I implemented it in java and integrate with UI. Teached clients how to solve their problem through our product.}
%        \item {The client of this project is Hyundai Motor. And the project type is PoC.}
        \item {And the project type is PoC.}
