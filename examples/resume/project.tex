      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s)
        \item {The eDataLyzer is a existing semiconductor analytics product for wafer yield map classification and root cause correlation.}
        \item {The goal of this project is to redevelop the eDataLyzer for big data.}
        \item {Introduced how to freely host the web application with high performance utilizing global CDN services.}
        \item {So we have led this project in three ways.}
        \item {1st, reconstruct the architecture to micro services from monolithic one.}
        \item {2nd, reorganize to a role based teams from a unified team.(Client, Server, Algorithm, Research, Technical Sales/Support.)}
        \item {3rd, redevelop by Java and C\# not only C\#}
        \item {I belong to Algorithm team, mainly focusing on parallelizing algorithm by new big data technologies.}
        \item {In briefly, I have done three ways of parallelizing algorithms.}
        \item {1st, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Java, PostgreSQL, Spring for small data clients.}
        \item {2nd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by non Hadoop based technologies.(GreenPlumDataBase PL/Java, Oracle-R)}
        \item {3rd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Hadoop based technologies.(Hadoop, BDA, Hawq, HBase, Spark, Eco system)}
        \item {We have a lot of semiconductor clients.(Korea: Samsung Electronics, SKHynix, SKSiltron, Japan: Toshiba, Sharp, Taiwan: TSMC, China: BOE)}
