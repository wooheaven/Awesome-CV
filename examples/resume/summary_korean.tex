저는 개발자로 6년동안 수학자와 팀플레이어로 성장해왔습니다.
As a mathematician, I enjoy thinking procedurally like a puzzle.
At first, I should focus on small pieces.
The sooner I predict the completed view, the faster I can solve the puzzle easily.
As a team player, I enjoy cooperating passionately like a college basketball player.
Whether break time in game or train time before game, we discussed a lot.
What is needed, How to apply it, Which is better, finally Whether my team wins or not.
I want to grow into a better mathematician and team player.
